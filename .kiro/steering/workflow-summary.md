## 🛠 Development Workflow Process

### 1. **Issue Creation**
```markdown
## Feature Request: [Clear, specific title]

### Context
- Current system state and requirements
- User story or use case description
- Technical constraints and considerations

### Requirements
- [ ] Specific deliverable with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Testing requirements and validation
- [ ] Documentation and examples needed

### MCP Tools Needed
- [ ] Supabase (database operations)
- [ ] Firecrawl (research and content)
- [ ] Playwright (testing and validation)
- [ ] GitHub (repository management)
- [ ] Fetch (API integrations)

@claude Please implement following our AI DM architecture patterns.
```

### 2. **Autonomous Implementation**
1. **Research Phase**: Firecrawl MCP scrapes relevant D&D content
2. **Database Design**: Supabase MCP creates schema and migrations
3. **Code Implementation**: TypeScript with proper types and validation
4. **Testing**: Playwright MCP creates comprehensive test suites
5. **Documentation**: Generates usage examples and API docs
6. **PR Submission**: Professional PR with detailed description

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- **Automated Testing**: All MCP tools validated
- **Code Review**: Security, performance, and best practices
- **Human Approval**: Critical changes require manual review
- **Deployment**: Staging validation before production
